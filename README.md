# Ptychography code for WDD reconstruction and aberration measurement.
*********************************************************************
This is for ptychography reconstruction by the Wigner-distribution deconvolution (WDD)  method for 4DSTEM data.

The jupyternotebook file is the userguide

The codes were originally developed by Katsuaki Nakazawa(ICYS fellow at NIMS, Japan)

and debugged and modified by
Kazutaka Mitsuishi (NIMS, Japan)
